CUDA Scheduling Viewer
======================

About
-----

This project was intended to provide a tool for examining block-level
scheduling behavior and coscheduling performance on CUDA devices. The tool is
capable of running any benchmark which can be self-contained in a shared
library file exporting specific functions. Currently, this tool only runs under
Linux, and is unlikely to support other systems in the future.


Compilation
-----------

This tool can only be run on a computer with a CUDA-capable GPU and with CUDA
installed. The `nvcc` command must be available on your PATH. The tool has not
been tested with devices earlier than compute capability 3.0 or CUDA versions
earlier than 8.0.

To build, clone the repository, `cd` into it, and run `make`.

Usage
-----

The tool must be provided a JSON configuration file, which will contain
information about which benchmark libraries to run, how to run them, and what
parameters to give file. `configs/simple.json` has been provided as a minimal
example, running one instance of the `mandelbrot.so` benchmark. To run it:

```bash
./bin/runner ./configs/simple.json
```

Additionally, the character `-` may be used in place of a config file name, in
which case the tool will attempt to read a JSON configuration object from
stdin. The file will be read completely before any benchmarks begin execution.

Some scripts have been included to visualize results. They require python,
numpy, and matplotlib. All such scripts are located in the scripts directory.
For example:

```bash
# Run all known configurations
find configs/*.json -exec ./bin/runner {} \;

# Visualize the scheduling timelines for each scenario
python scripts/view_timelines.py
```

Configuration Files
-------------------

The configuration files specify parameters passed to each benchmark along with
some global settings for the entire program.

The layout of each configuration file is as follows:

```
{
  "name": <String. Required. The name of this scenario.>,
  "max_iterations": <Number. Required. Default cap on the number of iterations
    for each benchmark. 0 = unlimited.>,
  "max_time": <Number. Required. Default cap on the number of number of seconds
    to run each benchmark. 0 = unlimited.>,
  "use_processes": <Boolean, defaulting to false. If this is true, each
    benchmark is run in a separate process. Normally, they run as threads.>
  "cuda_device": <Number. Required. The CUDA device to use for benchmarks to
    use.>,
  "base_result_directory": <String, defaulting to "./results". This is the
    directory into which individual JSON files from each benchmark will be
    written. It must already exist.>,
  "pin_cpus": <Boolean. Optional, defaults to false. If true, attempt to pin
    benchmarks to CPU cores, evenly distributed across cores. If true,
    individual benchmark cpu_core settings are ignored.>,
  "benchmarks": [
    {
      "filename": <String. Required. The path to the benchmark file, relative
        to the current working directory.>,
      "log_name": <String. Optional. The filename of the JSON log for this
        particular benchmark. If not provided, this benchmark's log will be
        given a default name based on its filename, process and thread ID. If
        this doesn't start with '/', it will be relative to
        base_result_directory.>,
      "label:": <String. Optional. A label or name for this specific benchmark,
        to be copied to its output file.>,
      "thread_count": <Number. Required, but may be ignored. The number of CUDA
        threads this benchmark should use.>,
      "block_count": <Number. Required, but may be ignored. The number of CUDA
        blocks this benchmark should use.>,
      "data_size": <Number. Required, but may be ignored. The input size, in
        bytes, for the benchmark.>,
      "additional_info": <String. Optional. This can be used to pass additional
        benchmark-specific configuration parameters.>,
      "max_iterations": <Number. Optional. If specified, overrides the default
        max_iterations for this benchmark alone. 0 = unlimited.>,
      "max_time": <Number. Optional. If specified, overrides the default
        max_time for this benchmark alone. 0 = unlimited.>,
      "release_time": <Number. Optional. If set, this benchmark will sleep for
        the given number of seconds (between initialization and the start of
        the first iteration) before beginning execution.>,
      "cpu_core": <Number. Optional. If specified, and pin_cpus is false, the
        system will attempt to pin this benchmark onto the given CPU core.>
    },
    {
      <more benchmarks can be listed here>
    }
  ]
}
```

Automatic Benchmark Generation
------------------------------

The script located in `scripts/multikernel_generator.py` illustrates how
config generation can be scripted. To run a scenario automatically generated by
this script, run the following command (after running `make`):

```bash
python scripts/multikernel_generator.py | ./bin/runner -
```

Output File Format
------------------

Each benchmark, when run, will generate a JSON log file at the location
specified in the configuration. If the benchmark did not complete successfully,
the JSON file may be in an invalid state. Times will be recorded as
floating-point numbers of seconds. The format of the log file is:

```
{
  "scenario_name": "<Scenario name>",
  "benchmark_name": "<benchmark name>",
  "label": "<this benchmark's label, if given in the config>",
  "max_resident_threads": <The maximum number of threads that can be assigned
    to the GPU at a time (from all benchmarks in the scenario)>,
  "data_size": <data size>,
  "release_time": <requested release time in seconds>,
  "PID": <pid>,
  "TID": <The thread ID, if benchmarks were run as threads>,
  "times": [
    {},
    {
      "kernel_name": <The name of this particular kernel. May be omitted.>,
      "block_count": <The number of blocks in this kernel invocation.>,
      "thread_count": <The number of threads per block in this invocation.>,
      "kernel_times": [<start time>, <end time>, ...],
      "block_times": [<start time>, <end time>, ...],
      "block_smids": [<block 0 SMID>, <block 1 SMID>, ...],
      "cpu_core": <the current CPU core being used>,
    },
    ...
  ]
}

```

Notice that the first entry in the "times" array will be blank and should be
ignored.

Creating New Benchmarks
-----------------------

Each benchmark must be contained in a shared library and abide by the interface
specified in `src/library_interface.h`. In particular, the library must export
a `RegisterFunctions` function, which provides the addresses of further
functions to the calling program. Benchmarks, preferably, should never use
global state and instead use the `user_data` pointer returned by the
initialize function to track all state. Global state may function if only one
instance of each benchmark is run at a time, but this will never be a
limitation of the default benchmarks included in this project. All benchmarks
must use a user-created CUDA stream in order to avoid unnecessarily blocking
each other.

The most important piece of information that each benchmark provides is the
`TimingInformation` struct, filled in during the `copy_out` function of each
benchmark. This struct will contain a list of `KernelTimes` structs, one for
each kernel invocation called during `execute`. Each `KernelTimes` struct will
contain the kernel start and end times, individual block start and end times,
and a list of the SM IDs to which blocks were assigned. The benchmark is
responsible for ensuring that the buffers provided in the TimingInformation
struct remain valid at least until another benchmark function is called. They
will not be freed by the caller.

In general, the comments in `library_interface.h` provide an explanation for
the actions that every library-provided function is expected to carry out.
The existing libraries in `src/mandelbrot.cu` and `src/timer_spin.cu` provide
examples of working library implementations.

Benchmark libraries are invoked by the master process as follows:

 1. The shared library file is loaded using the `dlopen()` function, and the
    `RegisterFunctions` function is located using `dlysym()`.

 2. Depending on the configuration, either a new process or new thread will be
    created for each benchmark.

 3. In its own thread or process, the benchmark's `initialize` function will
    be called, which should allocate and initialize all of the local state
    necessary for one instance of the benchmark.

 4. When the benchmark begins running, a single iteration will consist of the
    benchmark's `copy_in`, `execute`, and `copy_out` functions being called, in
    that order.

 5. When enough time has elapsed or the maximum number of iterations has been
    reached, the benchmark's `cleanup` function will be called, to allow for
    the benchmark to clean up and free its local state.
